# DataStreaming-Algorithms
Algorithms that work in one pass of the data

This project is a port of John D. Cook's RunningStats and RunningRegression to C#. I've also added a RunningPercentile
class and a RunningStatsDS which will compute the Stats and Regressions between all variables in a data set.

The functions support passing data as either plain doubles, arrays, or lists depending on the class. If you need to support
other datatypes, adding support should be simple.
